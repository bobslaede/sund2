## Who is Buckets for?

### Content creators, publishers, and strategists

By providing a simple, intuitive interface for defining content structure and relationships, we allow non-technical users to take a part in determining the architecture of their content — completely separate of any presentational aspects. Content contributors will be able to add, edit, and manage content in the simplest way possible: So it feels less like managing a database, and more like using a social app.

Additionally, Buckets will allow for a traditional role-based publishing approach: So contributors, editors, and managers can have different permissions on a per-Bucket basis.

### Web Designers & Developers

With a simple publishing layer, web designers are given full access to the content stored in Buckets by way of Templates and Routes. Routes allow website creators to create flexible URL structures by defining URL patterns that map to Templates. Templates have a variety of custom tags that makes pulling content from various Buckets and designing with it a breeze—all that’s required is knowing basic HTML and CSS.

### App Developers

Developers of any kind will be able to make use Buckets’ simple REST API for retrieving content. Node.js developers will be able to use Buckets as an NPM module and deploy it as middleware — allowing Buckets to be a part of a larger application stack. Buckets could be used to bootstrap data for a new app, or supplement an existing app with a web publishing layer.

## Who is it not for?

Buckets will not be for the layperson that does not know basic HTML/CSS. The user who thinks “I need a blog/website, where do I pick my template?” would be better served by sites like [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) or [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com).
