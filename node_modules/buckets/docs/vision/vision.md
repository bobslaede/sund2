# Buckets

## A modern Open Source CMS for Node.js and MongoDB

Buckets primary mission is to help people manage content better. It serves many different use-cases for publishers, web designers, and developers. We aim to do this by crafting a friendly, first-rate experience around defining data structures and allowing users to relate, extract, and publish their content in the fastest, easiest way possible. Content creators on the platform will enjoy a streamlined, customized interface for adding and managing data.

## General Philosophies

* Content management should be de-coupled from web publishing
* Managing content should not feel like administrating a database
* Open Source software can have the same level of polish and detail as world-class social services
* Delight plays a critical role in the user experience. Speed, animations, and intuitive interfaces are all major priorities.
* Leverage and expose portions of the technical stack with a simple interface to keep the architecture light, but consumer-usable.
* Building Buckets should be just as enjoyable as using Buckets

## The Future

There are several high-level features we are considering after we deliver on everything mentioned above:

* **Version control for posts**
* **Smart Buckets** which can import content from a variety of social sources, [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com)-style
* **Built-in tooling for web designers**: This means supporting things like Sass/Compass/CoffeeScript compilation, image optimization, etc. through a synced file-based system.

## Monetization

Buckets will include a built-in marketplace for plugins/extensions, even in its open source version. This will allow developers to monetize plugins (with Buckets taking a percentage) and foster an ecosystem which we control. Additionally, post “1.0” status, we plan to allow users to sign up to Buckets as a SaaS app with monthly paid accounts.
