By contributing to Buckets development, designers and developers also earn a portion of its profit.\n\n### Ways to Contribute\n\n#### Development\n\nBuckets is developed primarily in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and has no shortage of tasks whether [frontend](https://assembly.com/buckets/wips?tag=backend) or [backend](https://assembly.com/buckets/wips?tag=backend). Pull requests can be [submitted directly to Github](https://github.com/asm-products/buckets).\n\n#### Design\n\nIn addition to being open source, the Buckets design is a collaborative effort between designers on Assembly. Any UI or UX proposals or requests can be submitted as [a new bounty](https://assembly.com/buckets/wips/new) there.\n\n#### Voting\n\nWhether you're a designer or developer, creating a profile on Assembly and voting for bounties helps determine which features or bugs are addressed with priority."
